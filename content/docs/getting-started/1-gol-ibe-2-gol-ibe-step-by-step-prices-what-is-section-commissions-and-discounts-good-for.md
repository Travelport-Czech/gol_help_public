# Commissions and discounts

Airlines tend to give commissions from sold tickets to travel agencies less and less, but they still do. You can set up these commissions and GOL IBE will add them automatically to bookings.

You can also specify **discounts** in this section. Discounts may work independently of commissions, or you can set a discount equal to your earned commission. These two settings are combined but can also be used independently.

> **Note:** A separate rule must be created for each carrier.

In the admin console, go to **Prices → Commissions and discounts**.

## Available actions

- **ADD A RULE** — create a new rule
- **DETAIL** — view the detail of an already created rule
- **EDIT** — edit an existing rule

- **DELETE** — remove a rule you no longer need

## How to add a rule

Click **Add a rule** in the top-right corner.

### Priority

Specify the priority of the rule, starting from 1 (higher number = lower priority).

### Four options

### Airlines

Specify which carrier the rule applies to by selecting one in the **Plating carrier** field.

**Marketing carrier:**

- **Without restrictions** — no restrictions on marketing carrier.
- **Different marketing carriers** — the rule applies only if the itinerary includes at least one marketing carrier other than the plating carrier.
- **Plating carrier only** — the rule applies only if the itinerary uses the plating carrier exclusively.
- **Only other than plating carrier** — the rule applies only if the plating carrier is not in the itinerary.

**Operating carriers:**
