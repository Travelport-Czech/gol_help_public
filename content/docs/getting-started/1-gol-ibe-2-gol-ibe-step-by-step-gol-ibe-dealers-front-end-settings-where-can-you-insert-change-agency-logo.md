# Where can you insert / change the agency logo on your GOL IBE front-end?

<!-- tags: logo, agency logo, branding, front-end, image, header -->

Your agency logo appears in the header of the GOL IBE booking engine front-end. You can set and update it via **Dealers - Frontend settings**.

## How to set the logo

1. Log into the GOL IBE admin console.
2. Go to **Dealers → Dealers** → your dealer → **Front-end settings**.
3. Find the field **Logo URL**.
4. Enter the full URL of your logo image (must be publicly accessible, e.g. `https://youragency.com/logo.png`).
5. Click **Save**.
6. Go to **Code Lists → Flush HTML Caches**.

## Logo image requirements

| Property | Recommended value |
|----------|------------------|
| Format | PNG (with transparent background) or SVG |
| Width | 200–400 px |
| Height | 50–100 px |
| File size | Under 100 KB |
| Background | Transparent (for best appearance on any background colour) |

## Tips

- Host the logo on a stable, publicly accessible URL — if the file moves, the logo disappears on the front-end
- After changing the logo URL, flush HTML caches so customers see the new logo immediately
- Test the logo on both desktop and mobile — it may be scaled differently on small screens
